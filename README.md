## Getting started

To get started, clone this repository to your machine and open it in an IDE of your choice. Then, go back to GitHub and create a new repository, but do not check the box to include a README and do not add a license.

Next, you want to create two new .env files for your test and development data, then add the database names to it like this:
```JavaScript
PGDATABASE=database_name_here
```
